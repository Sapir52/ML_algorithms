Implementing algorithms in C++

# The project's target
1. Code a classic back-propagation neural net, with adjustable gradient descent learning and adjustable momentum.
2. Implementing k-means clustering.
3. Implementing Naive Bayes Classifier.

It's based on neural network and algorithems in C++ Tutorial.
